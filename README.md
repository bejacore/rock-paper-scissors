# Rock Paper Scissors 

This project involves creating an interactive Rock Paper Scissors console game using JavaScript. Through this project, I was able to demonstrate my new knowledge of functions, scope, conditional statements, and the while loop. I also used some string methods to manipulate the user's input for the proper functioning of the code.
